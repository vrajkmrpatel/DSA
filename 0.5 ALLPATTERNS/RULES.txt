HERE WE ARE USING NESTED LOOPS FOR PATTERNS
SO CALCULATE ROWS AND COLUMNS BEFOREHAND

RULES:

1) FOR OUTER LOOP COUNT THE NUMBER OF ROWS
2) FOR INNER LOOP FOCUS ON THE COLUMNS AND CONNECT THEM SOMEHOW TO THE ROWS
3) WHATEVER YOU ARE PRINTING PRINT IT INSIDED THE INNER LOOP
4) OBSERVE THE SYMMETRY (OPTIONAL STEP)
